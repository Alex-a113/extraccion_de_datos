Tucked between Shaw and Eckington on the border of the District’s northwest quadrant, Bloomingdale stretches from Second Street NW to North Capitol, bordered by Florida Avenue NW to the south and Bryant and Channing places NW to the north.<br /><br />Bloomingdale is known for its ample rowhouses — their colorful conic and pyramidal turrets are even featured in the opening credits of Netflix’s “House of Cards.” The large homes draw families and young renters looking for roommates, and many are split into smaller units.<br /><br />Tucked away behind stately rowhouses, Crispus Attucks Park is the buried treasure in Bloomingdale’s center. At just over an acre, the park is like Brigadoon, appearing only once you’ve walked a few dozen yards down an alley between U or V streets NW.

My international travels include stays in Amsterdam, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, the U.K., all across the U.S., and throughout the Caribbean to name a few. 

I enjoy meeting people and enhancing their travel experience when they visit Washington, DC. I am very resourceful and always willing to be of assistance. I enjoy knowing that the experience is rewarding for my guests as much as it is for me when I travel.

In the years following World War II, restrictive covenants which had prevented Jews and African Americans from purchasing homes in the neighborhood were no longer enforced, and the neighborhood became largely Jewish and African American. Over the past 40 years, the Jewish population of the neighborhood has declined (though it is now increasing again) but the neighborhood has continued to support a thriving upper and middle class African American community. The Shepherd Park Citizens Association and Neighbors Inc. led efforts to stem white flight from the neighborhood in the 1960s and 1970s, and it has remained a continuously integrated neighborhood, with very active and inclusive civic groups.<br /><br />Shepherd Park and the rest of Ward 4 were represented in the Council of the District of Columbia by Muriel Bowser, until her election as Mayor of the District of Columbia in the fall of 2014.
